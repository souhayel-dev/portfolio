# Simple Portfolio

This is a **short and simple portfolio project** created as requested.  
It’s built using **pure HTML, CSS, and  little JavaScript**, with no frameworks or external dependencies or code.

The goal of this project is to showcase a **short and not responsive** — not a full repository setup or large project.
